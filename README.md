# mev-lioness
An implementation of the NetZoo LIONESS algorithm (https://netzoo.github.io/zooanimals/lioness/) adapted for use with WebMeV.

This repository contains WDL-format files for executing Lioness using a Cromwell job runner. However, you may also choose to execute using the shell commands contained in `main.wdl` inside of the Docker containers defined in the `docker/` directory (or downloaded from https://github.com/web-mev/mev-lioness/pkgs/container/mev-lioness).
